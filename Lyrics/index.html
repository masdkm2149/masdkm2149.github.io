  <h1><em>You'll Find Her Name Written There </em>(Lyrics)</h1>
    <h2>By Bill Monroe</h2>

    <p id="lineOne">On and on she'll walk this earth</p>
    <p id="lineTwo">Her face like a beautiful flower</p>
    <p id="lineThree">But all alone is a marble stone</p>
    <p id="lineFour">You'll find her name written there</p>
    <p id="lineFive" class="newLine">Her new voice rings where the angels sing</p>
    <p id="lineSix">Her voice so pure and so fair</p>
    <p id="lineSeven">And if you'll look in the Heavenly book</p>
    <p id="lineEight">You'll find her name written there</p>
    <p id="lineNine" class="newLine">I'm all alone since the call of fate</p>
    <p id="lineTen">Left me in deepest despair</p>
    <p id="lineEleven">And if you'll wait at the pearly gate</p>
    <p id="lineTwelve">You'll find her name written there</p>
    <p id="lineThirteen" class="newLine">I'll breathe her name into the air</p>
    <p id="lineFourteen">It goes and I know not where</p>
    <p id="lineFifteen">But if you look to the heart of a friend</p>
    <p id="lineSixteen">You'll find her name written there </p>
